"""Loader + merge contract for `.specify/companion.yml` (the node-hook / recipe config).

The orchestrator is PROSE — at run time the AI reads `companion.yml` and acts on
it. This module is the executable spec of that contract: it parses the same file,
merges hooks in declared order, resolves a recipe's node-list override, validates
`reads:` against the active node set, and applies the failure table. CI unit-tests
it so the prose and the code never drift.

Failure table (mirrors mark-complete's "never fail the host command" tone):
  - absent companion.yml      -> shipped defaults, no warning
  - malformed companion.yml   -> shipped defaults + a warning
  - hook anchor not in recipe -> warn + skip that anchor's hooks
  - type: node, ref: missing  -> error

Stdlib only — includes a minimal YAML reader for the constrained config subset
(block maps, block seqs, inline flow maps/seqs, quoted/bare scalars). Anything
outside that subset raises, which the loader surfaces as "malformed".
