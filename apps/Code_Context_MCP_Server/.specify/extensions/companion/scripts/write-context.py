"""Write/update a feature's .spec-context.json from a spec-kit lifecycle hook.

Invoked by the `speckit.companion.after-*` command-markdowns (registered on the
spec-kit lifecycle hooks). Resolves the active feature directory using spec-kit's
own precedence, then does a crash-safe read-merge-write of the Companion's
canonical .spec-context.json:

  - preserves every existing/unknown top-level key (read-then-merge)
  - appends to the canonical `history[]` (append-only; never rewritten or
    shrunk), migrating a legacy `transitions[]` array forward so the extension
    and the VS Code GUI write the same single field
  - writes atomically (temp file + os.replace)
  - emits Companion-canonical values; never the legacy `currentStep: "done"`

This module owns the command line, the step lifecycle, the journal, terminal
promotion, and the no-regress guard. The rest lives in siblings — `spec_context`
(the store), `spec_deltas` (the delta grammar), `capture` (the additive capture
writers), `task_sync` (task markers and the per-task journal), and
`living_spec_fold` (the fold-back). Every name they hold is re-exported here, so
anything that imports this module keeps reaching them by their original path.

Stdlib only. Safe to run anywhere `python3` is available.
