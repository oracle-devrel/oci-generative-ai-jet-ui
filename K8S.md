# Accelerating AI Application Deployment Using Cloud Native Strategies

## Introduction

Kubernetes has become the standard for managing containerized applications, and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Container Engine for Kubernetes (OKE) is a managed Kubernetes service that delivers outstanding cloud reliability. Now, imagine using OKE with AI to create powerful, scalable, highly available AI applications.

This project deploys an AI pipeline with a multipurpose front end for text generation and summarization. The pipeline integrates with a database to track interactions, enabling fine-tuning and performance monitoring for application optimization. It leverages OCI Generative AI APIs on a Kubernetes cluster.

## Requirements

You need to be an administrator.

> If not should have enough privileges for OKE, Network, and Database services. Plus others like tenancy inspect. See example:
>
> ```
> Allow group 'Default'/'GroupName' to inspect tenancies in tenancy
> ```

## Set Up environment

On Cloud Shell, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/oracle-devrel/oci-generative-ai-jet-ui.git
```

Build the Environment container image

```bash
docker build -t environment oci-generative-ai-jet-ui
```

Run Docker container to run Node scripts

```bash
docker run \
  -e OCI_TENANCY=$OCI_TENANCY \
  -v $(pwd)/oci-generative-ai-jet-ui:/usr/genia \
  -v $(pwd)/.oci:/home/genia/.oci \
  -it --rm --name node \
  environment \
  bash
```

Change to the new folder:

```bash
cd oci-generative-ai-jet-ui
```

```bash
cd /usr/genia
```

Install dependencies for scripts.

```bash
cd scripts/ && npm install && cd ..
```

### Set the environment variables

Generate `genai.json` file with all environment variables.

```bash
npx --yes zx scripts/setenv.mjs
```

>

> Answer the Compartment name where you want to deploy the infrastructure. Root compartment is the default.

### Deploy Infrastructure

Generate `terraform.tfvars` file for Terraform.

```bash
npx zx scripts/tfvars.mjs
```

```bash
cd deploy/terraform
```

Init Terraform providers:

```bash
terraform init
```

Apply deployment:

```bash
terraform apply --auto-approve
```

```bash
cd ../..
```

## Release and create Kustomization files

Build and push images:

```bash
npx zx scripts/release.mjs
```

Create Kustomization files

```bash
npx zx scripts/kustom.mjs
```

### Kubernetes Deployment

```bash
export KUBECONFIG="$(pwd)/deploy/terraform/generated/kubeconfig"
```

```bash
kubectl cluster-info
```

```bash
kubectl apply -k deploy/k8s/overlays/prod
```

Run `get deploy` a few times:

```bash
kubectl get deploy -n backend
```

Wait for all deployments to be `Ready` and `Available`.

```
NAME                       READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
backend                    1/1     1            1           3m28s
ingress-nginx-controller   1/1     1            1           3m17s
web                        1/1     1            1           3m21s
```

Access your application:

```bash
echo $(kubectl get service \
  -n backend \
  -o jsonpath='{.items[?(@.spec.type=="LoadBalancer")].status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}')
```

> This command will list the Load Balancer services on the `backend` namespace. If the response is an empty string, wait a bit and execute the command again. The Load Balancer takes a bit of time to create the Public IP address.

Paste the Public IP address on your browser and test your new Generative AI website deployed in Kubernetes.

Remember to visit SQL Developer Web on the OCI Console for your Oracle Database and run some queries to investigate the historical of prompts.

```sql
SELECT * FROM interactions;
```

```bash
cd ../..
```

## Clean up

Delete Kubernetes components

```bash
kubectl delete -k deploy/k8s/overlays/prod
```

Destroy infrastructure with Terraform.

```bash
cd deploy/terraform
```

```bash
terraform destroy -auto-approve
```

```bash
cd ../..
```

Clean up the artifacts on Object Storage

```bash
npx zx scripts/clean.mjs
```
