## Introduction

Using Oracle JET, create a user-friendly prompt-led user interface (UI) to interact with Oracle's new Generative AI service. This toolkit will configure your Generative AI Service connection so you can begin your journey with AI, or migrate your existing (local or Cloud) LLMs to the Oracle AppDev ecosystem.

This project deploys an AI pipeline with a multipurpose front end for text generation and summarization. The pipeline integrates with a database to track interactions, enabling fine-tuning and performance monitoring for application optimization. It leverages OCI Generative AI APIs on a Kubernetes cluster.
